# Motor Control SDK
These files are taken from Texas Instruments C2000ware motor control SDK.  All files have BSD-3-Clause and all files retain TI copyright.  I guess this is OK to put in github as discussed in E2E TI forum, ([link](https://e2e.ti.com/support/motor-drivers-group/motor-drivers/f/motor-drivers-forum/1293429/motorware-on-github)).
